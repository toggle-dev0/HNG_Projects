            Frontend development is a crucial aspect of web development, as it
            involves creating the user interface that allows users to interact
            with a website or application. As a college student studying
            computer science, I am already familiar with HTML, CSS, and
            JavaScript, but I want to deepen my understanding of these languages
            and learn new technologies and frameworks that will help me become a
            more proficient frontend developer. In the next two years, I plan on
            focusing on honing my skills in frontend development.

            One of my main goals is to become proficient in React, a popular
            JavaScript library for building user interfaces. React is widely
            used in the industry and is known for its efficiency and
            flexibility. By mastering React, I will be able to create dynamic
            and interactive user interfaces that will enhance the user
            experience. I also plan on learning other frontend development tools
            and frameworks such as Angular, Vue.js, and SASS to expand my skill
            set and stay competitive in the job market.

          <p>
            In addition to learning new technologies, I also plan on gaining
            real-world experience by working on personal projects and
            contributing to open-source projects. A way I found to work on
            real-world projects is by joining the

              >2024 HNG11 internship</a
            >.
            By building my own websites and applications, I will be able to
            apply my knowledge in a practical setting and showcase my skills to
            potential employers. Contributing to open-source projects will also
            allow me to collaborate with other developers, learn from their
            expertise, and make a positive impact on the developer community.

            Overall, my plans for frontend development in the next two years
            involve continuous learning, hands-on experience, and collaboration
            with other developers. By focusing on mastering new
            technologies/tools e.g
            <a
              href="https://www.keyword.dog"
              data-testid="keywordLink"

              >Keyword.dog</a
            >
            and
            <a
              href="https://www.scrapeanyweb.site"

              data-testid="scrapeanywebLink"
              >Scrapeanyweb.site</a
            >, building personal projects, and contributing to open-source
            projects, I hope to become a skilled and well-rounded frontend
            developer who is ready to take on the challenges of the rapidly
            evolving tech industry. I am excited about the opportunities that
            lie ahead and look forward to seeing where my frontend development
            journey will take me.
